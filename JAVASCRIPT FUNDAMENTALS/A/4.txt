There is a need to declare a variable in javascript because: 
Variables are used to store data of different types, such as numbers, strings, objects, and arrays. This data can be used throughout the program and manipulated as needed.
Variables provide a meaningful name to the data being stored, making it easier to understand and use the code.
By grouping related variables together, code becomes more readable and maintainable.
Declaring variables can improve the performance of JavaScript programs by allowing the compiler to optimize code execution.

Declaration: let name="Nitin Khare"
