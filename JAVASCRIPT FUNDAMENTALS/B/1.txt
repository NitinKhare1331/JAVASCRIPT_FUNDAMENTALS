Operators are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on values in JavaScript. They are essential for performing computations, making decisions, and manipulating data in programming.

Operators are essential in programming because they allow us to perform complex operations on data. For example, we can use arithmetic operators to calculate the total price of an order, comparison operators to determine if a customer is eligible for a discount, and logical operators to decide whether to display a message to the user.

Without operators, we would not be able to perform any operations on data and our programs would be very limited.
