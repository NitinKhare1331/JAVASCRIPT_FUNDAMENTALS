Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression. Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).

The associativity of an operator specifies the order in which operations of the same precedence are performed. Left-to-right associativity means that operations are performed from left to right.

In conclusion, understanding operator precedence and associativity rules is essential for writing correct and efficient code in JavaScript.
